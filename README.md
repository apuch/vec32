# Vec32

## Introduction

This is a basic library for float32-vector- and -matrix-operations. 
Currently its only a basic (stupid) implementation of the most needed
functionality and could be optimized with inline asm, etc. 

The current status is _HIGHLY_ unstable. Do not rely on this API for any 
of your projects.
